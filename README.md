# Speaker-Anti-Spoofing-Classifiers
Classifiers for speaker anti-spoofing detection.

Evaluation scripts are directly taken from the baseline of the ASVspoof2019 challenge, seen [here](https://www.asvspoof.org/asvspoof2019/tDCF_python_v1.zip)


## Datasets

The most broadly used datasets for spoofing detection (currently) are:

* [ASVspoof2019](https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3336) encompassing logical and physical attacks alike
* [ASVspoof2017](https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3055) encompassing only physical attacks with the focus on `in the wild` devices and scenes.
* [ASVspoof2015](https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/853) encompassing only logical attacks with the focus on synthesize and voice conversion attacks.
