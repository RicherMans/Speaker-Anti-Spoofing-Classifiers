# Data processing scripts

For each dataset ASV{15, 17, 19} and FoR datasets, here are some scripts to download and pre-process the data for later feature extraction.

For most usecases, just firstly download a dataset e.g., `download_asv17.sh` and then run `prepare_asv17.sh`.

If for some reason, you have downloaded all the dataset files into another directory, just pass that root directory to the `prepare*` script.
